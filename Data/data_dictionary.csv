FGA,Fraction Genome Altered (rounded)
Fraction Genome Altered,Fraction Genome Altered indicates the fraction of the genome that is copy-number altered. Add the length of all copy-number segments with an absolute value greater than 0.1 and then divide that number by the length of the genome. The resulting number is a fraction.
Gene Panel,ID of the gene panel used for genetic sequencing
Metastatic patient,True or False: if patient had metastatic disease or not
Metastatic Site,The anatomic location where tumour has spread
Met Count,Number of metastasis found
Met Site Count,Number of different metastatic sites
MSI Score,Numerical value of the amount of Microsatellite Instability found in the tumour
MSI Type,Does tutor exhibit Microsatellite Instability
Mutation Count,Number of gene mutations found
Oncotree Code,The OncoTree is an open-source ontology that was developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) for standardizing cancer type diagnosis from a clinical perspective by assigning each diagnosis a unique OncoTree code.
Organ System,Organ System where the cancer was found
Overall Survival (Months),Number of months that patient survived from initial diagnosis
Overall Survival Status,"Survival status:â€¨0:LIVING, 1:DECEASED"
Primary Tumor Site,The organ sub-division where the primary tumour was found
Race Category,Patient information about race
Number of Samples Per Patient,Number of samples taken per patient in the study
Sample coverage,The number of unique sequencing reads that align to a region in a reference genome
Sample Type,Primary tumour or metastasis
Sex,Biological gender at birth
Subtype,Cancer subtype
Subtype Abbreviation,Cancer subtype abbreviation
TMB (nonsynonymous),The number of non-synonymous mutations within coding regions across the genome. Non-synonymous mutations alter coding regions and change the resulting protein into dysfunctional or malformed protein products.
Tumor Purity,The proportion of tumour cells in the tumour micro environment (TME)
