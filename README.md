## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview 

This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to attempt to increase the accuracy of estimating cancer prognosis and survivability using demographic features as well as disease status, progression and genetic.  If successful, it will  aid in the improvement of the quality of life for patients and their loved ones.

## Project Motivation

##  ðŸ’½ The Data
The data used for this project was downloaded from the cBioPortal for Cancer genomics:
https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=msk_met_2021 from the MSK MetTropism (MSK, Cell 2021) study. 

This public site is hosted by the Centre for Molecular Oncology at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre.

Each of the 25775 instances are a unique pateint in the study with each column a different attirbute of this patient and their disease.
Including:
- Tumour Mutational Burden
- Metastatic status
- Primary and metastatic tumour sites
- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Microsattelite Instability status
- Tumor Purity
- Fractional Genome Altered
- Primary cancer type
