## 🔎 Project Overview 

This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to attempt to increase the accuracy of estimating cancer prognosis and survivability using demographic features as well as disease status, progression and genetic.  If successful, it will  aid in the improvement of the quality of life for patients and their loved ones.

<h2 id="motivation"> 💪🏽 Project Motivation </h2>

The motivation for this project is a a personal and professional connection to cancer. Like the majority of people I have been personally, indirectly affected by cancer. I also worked in clinical cancer diagnosis and detection for 7+ years and have a deep seeded interest in the field.  Cancer prognosis and survivability affects patients, their friends and family, and their quality of life.


Accuracy in prognosis predictions is very important. When a patient is given a prognosis, they begin to map out the remainder of their time.  When the prognosis is inaccurate, some are lucky and they are given more time but there are some that are not so lucky and are taken sooner than anticipated.  Accurate prognosis can also help the currently overwhelmed and under-funded and under-staffed healthcare systems around the world. It can help with resource mangement to alloccate precious time, space and treatment resources to those who will benefit the most.


Cancer prognosis affects everyone involved from pateints to families to health care staff and I hope to develop a model that can better predict this metric to make living with cancer better for everyone.


<h2 id="data">📊 The Data</h2>
The data used for this project was downloaded from the cBioPortal for Cancer genomics:
https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=msk_met_2021 from the MSK MetTropism (MSK, Cell 2021) study. 

This public site is hosted by the Centre for Molecular Oncology at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre.

Each of the 25775 instances are a unique pateint in the study with each column a different attirbute of this patient and their disease.
Including:
- Tumour Mutational Burden
- Metastatic status
- Primary and metastatic tumour sites
- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Microsattelite Instability status
- Tumor Purity
- Fractional Genome Altered
- Primary cancer type

Project progression:

Thus far I have completed the `Data Collection`, the preliminary `Data Cleaning` and the initial `EDA`.  I am currently on the `Data Splitting and Model Selection` portion of the project. This will be an iterative process, which may include the need to revisit my EDA and data cleaning to increase the power of my chosen model. 

Stay tuned for updates!
